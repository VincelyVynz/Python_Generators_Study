Once upon a time, in a small village nestled between rolling hills and thick forests, there lived a boy named Elias.
He was known for his curiosity, often wandering far from home just to see what lay beyond the horizon.

One day, while exploring the edge of the woods, he stumbled upon a curious stone tower.
Its walls were overgrown with ivy, and the door creaked ominously as he pushed it open.

Inside, the air was cool and musty. Books were piled high on wooden shelves, and a faint light glowed from the spiral staircase above.

"Hello?" Elias called out. No answer.

He stepped cautiously inside. Each step echoed under his feet as he climbed the narrow stairs.

At the top, he found a small room filled with maps, instruments, and a desk covered in parchment.
A window overlooked the valley, giving a view that stretched all the way to the river.

Suddenly, a voice behind him said, "You’re not supposed to be here."

Elias turned around to see an old man, his eyes sharp and his beard long and silver.

"I'm sorry," Elias stammered. "I didn’t mean to intrude."

The old man studied him for a moment, then smiled faintly. "Curiosity isn’t a sin. But it must be tempered with wisdom."

From that day on, Elias returned often. The man, a retired cartographer named Thoren, taught him about the stars, the winds, and the secrets of ancient paths.

Years passed, and the boy became a skilled traveler. He mapped lands that hadn’t been explored for generations.

Whenever someone asked him how he learned so much, he would smile and say,
"All it takes is one curious step... and someone willing to guide you."

In the village square, there still stands a plaque:
"To Elias, the boy who walked beyond the trees and charted the skies."

And in the tower, the books remain—waiting for the next wanderer to find them.
